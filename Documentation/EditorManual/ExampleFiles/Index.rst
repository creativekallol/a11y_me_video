**Sorry. The old example files no longer exist. For a better understanding of the content requirements for the media
files, you will find a similar video player on the following website:**

The main video, the sign language video and the mp3 file with audio description
must be in sync. This means that they all have the same timeline, so that you
can easily switch between them at any time.

A typical sign language video shows the original video in the background and the
sign language interpreter in the foreground.

The audio description is used as an alternative audio track. The audio
track contains the original sound and additional text spoken by a narrator.
Speech and audio gaps can be used to describe additional important visual
information for blind and visually impaired people.
